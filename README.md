Creating a website with the Django web framework is predominantly done in Python, leveraging its object-oriented capabilities. Understanding Python's core concepts and syntax is crucial, especially when adapting to updates in Django. This project emphasizes Python fundamentals, data structures, and object-oriented programming, providing a solid base for interacting with databases using Python. These skills will be invaluable when transitioning to Django for web development. Additionally, the project aims to instill standard programming practices, ensuring your code is clean, readable, and robust.
